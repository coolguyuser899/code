k8s is a control loop 
observe -> diff -> act ->

aws ack 

dev team 
s3 cr / deploy / rbac 
control plane -> etcd 
replace separate aws api with standard k8s spec crd resources 
aws s3 ack controller -> services in aws 
ops team 


aws controller for k8s - the aws universe of sevices, now kubeified 
new ack project , open souce cncf project which bridges k8s and aws services 

to create  / use aws services,they are not k8s 
console
aws cli tool
cloud formation 
terraform 

can aws resources be create using standard manifest yml file?
ack service controller , boom, 
allow developers familiar to k8s who can use aws in k8s way 
without leaving k8s 
k8s stores the desired resource state 
ack contoller handles the lifecycle of aws managed service resources 
no cloudformation benhd the scenes
improve user experience 
not eks specific, runs on any k9s 


is a redesign /rethink of aws operation / aso in 2018

don't want to have a super user / god level scope role for all aws services 
but prefer fine grained service level controller 
everything , including controller implementations is code-generated 
with 175 service apis, hand building controller is not feasible 
incluidng to aws linkage.go , ack runtime, combining model file with truth of api 

must be in rbac
must be in namespace 
secret uses reeference / name / key (not pwd)
tags, rate limititng, throttling supporting 

s3, sns, sqs, ecr, dynamodb, api gateway
https://github.com/aws/aws-controllers-k8s

cross plane adoption / 
helpful for integrating k8s with aws without having to depend ono eks 

use k8s api to describe not just k8s objects, but also resources on which you applications depends, ack , use ack to describe and manage their lifecycles,

#1
what is kubernetes
-greek word helmsmanship, pilot, abbreviated to k8s
-orcherastrator for container appliccations 
-open source project for microservice deployment 

what is kubernetes really 
-a database
-an api server 
-control loop (spec, status, define, diff, act)

what is not kubernetes 
-not an orchestation platform, loose independent, pluggable components
-not a platform for service, but a platfom for platform 
-not just for container applications

kubernetes cluster components
-control plane 
-work node 

kubernetes objects (dependency graph)
-pod/deployment
-service/ingress
-network 
-config/secrets
-storage
-network 
-job/cron jobs (before 1.25 timezone is not in spec to avoid complications)
-service account, role, rolebinding, namespace, quota

beyond k8s (control loop, ack amazon controller for )
-custom resouce definition
-operator
-example amazon controller for kubernettes 
-container application orchestration is not the complete story 

interesting facts about k8s 
-souce code, wordcloud
-github ranking, 3000 contributors
-549 release in past 8 years, 
-workload scheduler, chubby, borg, to api + docker 

#2
k8s security 

overview 
-cloud native cloud native servey 2017, 2022
-sans session mentioned low pass rate on kubernetes certifications
-steep learning curl, new concepts and contant changes

can we use k8s to secure k8s clusters?
-yes to certain extent
-has built in featues 
-security features are improving 
-support 3 minor versions

introducing cloud native 4Cs
-code 
-container
-cluster (kubernetes)
-cloud / corp data center

kubernetes runs in cluster of machines or vm 
-mainly on linux, because of chmod, cgroup, container runtime 
-pod / containers runs on linux server 
-linux pholophy, everything is a file on linux (key point)

treat global as a single one computer
-kubernetes triggered another wave of distributed system innovation
-cloud native presents build once run anywhere 
-both opportunity and challenges (docker engine, side car overhead)

extended berkeley packet filter / express data path
-biggest linux kernel revolation in past 20 years 
-programmable kernel runtime software
-allow observability, networking, security 

interest facts about k8s security 
-kubernetes source code wordcloud
-10 kubernetes best practices wordcloud
-express data path used in facebook

built in and open source tools for k8s (map graph, wave style, 3d rotating)

summary 
a kubernetes hack
-2 conditions must be met 
-open url
-admin privilege of dashboard process 

cookoo's egg
-winning cyber spy war 
-art of fighting 

art of war 
-winning without fighting 5 factors
-art of war pholosophies
-know self know thee, hund battles hund win

formula of winning 
-success  = f ( knowledge, skills, talent) power of people 
-doing and learing are fundermental in today's IT world
-opportunities for both business and adversaries
