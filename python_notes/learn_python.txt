## Installing Jupyter with pip, an easy notebook style python editor
http://jupyter.org/install

As an existing or experienced Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Pythonâ€™s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.

If you have Python 3 installed (which is recommended):
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter

If you have Python 2 installed:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
jupyter notebook
