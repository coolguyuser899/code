# use of _ in python
# 1
Underscore _ is considered as "I don't Care" or "Throwaway" variable in Python
The python interpreter stores the last expression value to the special variable called _.
>>> 10
10
>>> _
10
>>> _ * 3
30

#2
The underscore _ is also used for ignoring the specific values. If you donâ€™t need the specific values or the values are not used, just assign the values to underscore.
Ignore a value when unpacking
x, _, y = (1, 2, 3)

>>>x
1
>>>y
3

Ignore the index
for _ in range(10):
    do_something()

# 3
For translation lookup in i18n (see the gettext documentation for example), as in code like:
raise forms.ValidationError(_("Please enter a correct username"))

to avoid conflicting, some pepole likes to use "__" double underscore as throwable variable

why rgb color take number of 256
rgb is stored in 8 bits, from 0 - 255, means 256 intensities per color channel
e.g.
color turquoise:
r: 64
g: 224
b: 208
computer stores as binary
r: 01000000
g: 11100000
b: 11010000
